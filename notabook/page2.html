    <h1>Why is Sustainability Important for the Fashion Industry?</h1>

    Fair Trade
    Fair Trade aims to protect farmers and workers basic rights in regards to unions, wages, conditions and more. Through fair trade clothing companies are able to make a difference for the lives of the people who grow and make the things we love. By companies holding this stamp on their products, it is an easy guaranteed to understand that the garments they produce comply with the rules of Fair Trade. People Tree is a clothing brand that has pioneered in Fair Trade production. For more than 25 years the have chosen to work with fair trade, primarily in regards to cotton farmers, producers garment workers and artisans to create a more sustainable fashion industry.

    Naturally Dyed
    Another important factor about the garment is how it is dyed. Today due to a strong interest in color vibrancy and price, synthetic dyes are a strong go to within the production of fashion. However though, by companies choosing to use synthetic dyes instead of natural, heavy production sites end up with polluted water filled with toxins and chemicals. To prevent this, a great method for companies instead is to choose to use natural dyes and materials. By sticking with things such as indigo, turmeric and onion shells the fashion industry can come back to a more historical and natural pace.

    Recycled
    To be able to create a circular economy it is important to keep the system of materials and goods going. A great way to do this within the fashion industry is to create future collections from either left over textiles or previously used materials. By brands reusing what already exists instead of creating things from new, we can also minimize the use of land, water and labour. A new brand created by H&M called Arket knows the value in materials and has decided to create sweaters from recycled cashmere! With Scandinavian design in mind, their knits embrace a coolness of modern fashion and sustainability all into one package.
